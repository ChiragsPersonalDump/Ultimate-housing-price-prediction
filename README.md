# Ultimate-housing-price-prediction
This is a ultimate project of housing price prediction , The entire data have been cleaned , filtered , scaled , trained and fine tuned rigorously over various levels . 
Data used for training : californina housing data 
No. of training examples : around 16 thousands.
No. of test examples : around 4 thousands.
Library/Dependencies : Numpy, Pandas , Matplotlib , sky-kit learn.
encoder used : one hot encoder 
models trained : linear regressor , decision tree regressor , random forest regressor.
Final model selected : random forest regressor
Accuracy tested using cross validation (RMSE) and (r squared value)
Grid search cv used for fine tuning of hyperparameters.

# Upon the final training : RMSE scores : 48100.394269148856 , R square scores : 82.24797610379628 %
# the overall performance of the model stands good and does not consider much over/underfitting issues (if any).
